    <h3> A Preview of the Working Prototype</h3>
    <iframe  class="center" style="border: none;" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FUwzTmd74LHswGt9CIApoeh%2FNetworking-App%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A2%26viewport%3D555%252C281%252C0.2815629243850708%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <h3>Identifying a Problem</h3>
    <p>You’ve probably heard the phrase in somewhere along your college career, “You need to network.”, “Networking is essential”, “The real way to break into industry is to network.”, but what exactly is networking, and how can I do it? <br>

           <br> Networking remains one of the vaguest catch-all terms for talking to people and establishing meaningful connections that can potentially lead to jobs through referrals, or even direct contact when positions open. The effectiveness of finding likeminded people, establishing that connection and using that to your advantage cannot be understated. For the top tech companies, a reference can be the difference between your resume being tossed into the trash, or a deeper look into what you can bring to a company, and that alone makes networking an essential part of any professional’s life, especially at the start of their career. <br> <br>However, networking at the start of your career is often the hardest, you don’t have any experience doing it, and often do not even know how to begin when the term “networking” is so vague. What constitutes networking?
            
           <br> <br> To establish this, I did some simple brainstorming on a whiteboard to guide my thoughts.
            </p>
    <div class="container">
    <img src="networking whiteboard.png">
</div>
    <p>The central idea is networking, and the target audience that I wanted to focus on was young professionals. After all, they have the least direct work experience, and their previous “network” was mainly high school-college aged friends, who are likely in different industries or not going towards the same goals. By tailoring the solution around college kids, it creates a more specific user experience, because they face different general problems than other client groups.

          <br><br>  Next, I wanted to define the “why” this is needed. In an age where networking is becoming so essential as technology is expanding, the proper support between meeting people becomes paramount. More so, many college-aged kids find it hard to meet people at first and need some sort of tool to lower the friction between people. The growing mental health problem in my generation often manifests as social anxiety and having a medium that can help interactions have less burden on the user can be helpful.
            
          <br><br>  Concentrating on the actual networking itself, and the method in which it is done, is prefaced on 1:1 conversation which is most effective in a face to face setting, preferably an event. This can help us think of ways to facilitate these meetings through the service. Trying to narrow down what people connect on by common interests, where they are from and perhaps their school can provide an early way to stimulate engagement between two people by providing common ground. The common theme between most mediums of networking is the exclusivity of being at the same event, or same area, or even same industry. This has to be one of the points to consider.
            
          <br><br> Furthermore, to consider how we would drive the product we are competing to market, we have to consider how we gain users. After all, a service that facilitates networking relies on having many users in many different locations and thus has to attract users effectively. One of the key ideas I wanted to focus on was creating a personalized experience that could assist users by providing them some tutorials and mentoring on how to network and build better connections. Another aspect I wanted to focus on was rewarding users for being active, this ensures that a large part of the user base would stay active past launch.
            
            </p>

        <h3>Proposing a Solution</h3>

        <p>All this comes towards a solution of creating a networking application that is predicated on using location services and a LinkedIn API to display users in your area that are ranked by how closely they match your profile and ambitions, so that you can choose who to reach out to. The application would also show events in your area, and allow you to host events as well, to further your connections. There would also be a part of the application dedicated to helping young professionals learn how to put themselves out there, and how to deal with the stress of starting out in the job industry. It combines wellness, and mindfulness into an application that furthers careers.

                <br><br>   Now we have highlighted a problem, and proposed a solution, now we have to design it.

        <h3>
                UX Research – Understanding what the Users want
        </h3>

        <p>To understand what users really want, I decided to focus on the target audience – young professionals, around the college age. The first method of gaining some primary data was through a simple interview. I tried to interview a more representative look at the population by varying age, gender, and profession to see if there was any variance between those different groups. I kept the interviews fairly short, and used uniform questions throughout.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>1. 	What do you think are the major elements in successfully networking?</li>
            <li>2. 	Do you find it hard to connect and network, especially with those other than you? What do you think is the hardest part about networking?</li>
            <li> 3.    Would you prefer a service that would assist you in finding those in your area of expertise?</li>
            <li>4. 	What kind of tools do you use in networking? Applications?</li>
            <li>5. 	Would you consider yourself good at networking? How did you get better, or what do you think you lack?</li>
            
        </ol>

      <p>Here are some quotes from the interview:  </p>  

      <img src="Interview 1.svg" style="max-width:40%">

      <img src="Interview 3.svg"style="max-width:40%">
      <img src="Interview 4.svg"style="max-width:40%">
      <img src="Interview 5.svg"style="max-width:40%">
      <!--<p> <i>Interview 1 – 22, CS Major, Man</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>1. “I think being in an environment where everyone is networking makes it easier, because you don’t feel like you’re being weird by asking them questions about themselves. Another thing is having genuine interest, when you are faking interest in what they are saying, they are going to pick up on that quick, and your interaction will end there.</li>
            <li>2. “Yes, mostly because the people in my friend group are not as career oriented, or in the same major as me, so a lot of the time I am not around the people that really land you jobs. The other main thing is that cold-messaging people on LinkedIn rarely works for me, likely because so many people do it.”</li>
            <li>3. “Yeah, I think that would really help, but I need to know more about the service to really consider using it.”</li>
            <li>4. “I mainly use LinkedIn, but I am pretty open to trying new things. I have not really searched for anything different yet. I am also on Handshake, but not really active.”</li>
            <li>5. 	“I do not really know how good I am, but I think that it’s hard for me to really reach out to people I do not really know, so it kind of limits me in that sense.”

                </li>
        </ol>

        <p><i>Interview 2 – 19, Design & Interaction Major, Woman</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>	1. “Being friendly is key, and I think treating them like a normal person, and with a normal conversation is the best way to then segue into a more serious talk about how to break into their field, or possibly get a job at their company.”</li>
            <li>	2. “Yes, I really have not had that much experience because I am only a 2nd year, and I feel like I do not really know enough to be talking to these people about working. It makes me a little scared to approach people, because I always fear that they will ask me questions.”</li>
            <li>3. “Yes, I do not really use anything to network right now, but I think that would be helpful.”</li>
            <li>4.“I am not really on any type of social platforms yet, I probably should get on LinkedIn, but waiting more real experience.”</li>
            <li>5.	“I think I am not that good because I get really nervous, especially when its people who are much older, and also more experienced, it makes me feel kind of intimidated.”</li>
        </ol>

       <p> <i>Interview 3 – 23, Management Science Major, Woman</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>    1. “I think really connecting with who you are talking to, and asking them questions about themselves to engage them, but also providing enough information that it isn’t just an interview.”</li>
            <li>	2. I think it’s not easy, but I think I have done it enough by being in a lot of on-campus groups that organize events solely for networking that helped me get better.</li>
            <li>	3. Yeah, I think having more services and tools to get to that next level is always appreciated, and you can never know too many people.</li>
            <li>	4. I use LinkedIn. I have tried some other tools, but none of them really stuck like LinkedIn.</li>
            <li>	5. I would say I am good; I think just talking to many different types of people gives you that experience and ability to be able to connect with anyone.</li>
        </ol>
    
       <p> <i>Interview 4 – 20, Literature Major, Man</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>	1. I honestly do not have much experience networking, but I think it’s mostly just paying attention to what they are saying and responding well.</li>
            <li>	2. I think so, especially because we aren’t really surrounded by people to network with at college, or at least you don’t really see it that way, so finding those people is hard.</li>   
            <li>	3. I think that would be a good idea, I would probably look into it.</li>
            <li>	4. I am semi-active on LinkedIn, but with my major I feel like it’s a little different.</li>
            <li>	5. I don’t know yet, but I really want to get good at it.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><i>Interview 5 – 22, Bioinformatics Major, Man</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>1.	Treating it like its more than a conversation places some expectations on them, so I think that keeping it professional is pretty big.</li>
            <li>2.	I think it really depends on what part of the country you are, being in San Diego and doing Bioinformatics, I think its easier for me than others, but in general finding people in your industry is kind of hard.</li>
            <li>3.	I think that’s a great idea, but it sounds pretty similar to LinkedIn.</li>
            <li>4.	I use LinkedIn, I am a premium member.</li>
            <li>5.	I think I am proficient, but I would not say that it is getting me jobs right now per se, but it definitely has allowed me to meet some interesting people.</li>

        </ol>-->

        <p><i>Key Takeaways</i></p>
        <p>Most people find that networking is something that is intrinsically hard, and often find it a daunting task. Making the user experience of Networking something that is looked at as a positive takes fostering the elements that create a good networking opportunity and presenting them to the user in a way that reduces the burden on them, and lessens that friction that stops them from going out and initiating a face to face meeting with a potential connection.

               <br><br> Another key thing that is semi-obvious is that LinkedIn is an industry standard and should be viewed as a companion rather than a competitor, providing integration with LinkedIn can make it faster to create profiles, and also to see professional history quickly.
                
               <br><br>    The user interviews also confirmed that there is a pull from the market for a service that would help with networking, since all 5 did not list any other competitors other than LinkedIn. 
                
               <br><br>  All 5 also found some problems and self-doubts regarding their own Networking skills, suggesting that showing people how to positively network using tutorials or mentorship might be a way to attract users, and also create a product that is needed by people, rather than wanted.</p>
                
        <h3>UX Design – Initial Sketches</h3>
        <p>To start to create prototypes I first want to start off by drawing some sketches that I would tweak over many iterations. To really understand how to display information to the user I must define the way that information flows. This can formally be called information architecture.
               <br><br> To structure this I must think how a logical application would go through the checks needed to initiate the app. To show my thinking I put a simple flow on a whiteboard.
                </p>

        <div class="container">
        <img src="networking IA.png">
    </div>
        <p>The user starts by logging into the application, this loads their data, for the first use I ask if the app can use their location for the location-based API’s. If the user does not consent they have a limited use of the app that is based on manual entry of location using zip code. If yes, then it initializes the app, and shows the 4 main points of navigation – Connect, Events, Learn, Me. These 4 subgroups show different functionalities of the application like showing the matching users near them, events based on location and relevancy, tutorials, and also a profile page to edit information. I would like to use a LinkedIn API, but knowing that some people might not have relevant experience but want to break into a field, letting the user input some information manually if they wish would allow them to tailor their results to their likings to provide a better user experience.

                <br><br>This can be represented in the wireframes below:
                </p>

        <div class="container">
        <img src="networking wireframe 1.png">
        </div>

        <p>Now that I have defined the overall architecture, I can start doing some sketches of what it could possibly look like.

                <br><br>My initial sketches are shown below.
                </p>
        <div class="container">
        <img src="networking sketch 1.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>This first sketch shows the initial login screens, and how it would flow to a customized welcome page that takes their name and displays a welcome message, this creates a more personal user experience. After the first login the screen on the bottom left is shown, by retaining the user information so that they just have to click login or use faceID/TouchID. While setting up it would ask some basic guider questions to tailor their user experience to fit them and their needs better.

            </p>
        <div class="container">
        <img src="networking sketch 2.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>This next group of sketches shows the connect, and events page respectively. I decided to choose connect page 2 because it lists people near with a photo for easy identification, and also includes 2 other ways to find people, with common interests or common school.

              <br><br>  While drawing these sketches I realized that a way to make some connections exclusive is to require a number of shared interests to connect, or if there are not enough shared interests between two people, they can ask questions to build that connection. This generates user activity, and also facilitates conversation, which is a key tenet of networking.
                
               <br><br> The events page is showcased on the bottom and makes use of location to display relevant events near the user. I chose design 3 due to its integration of maps which would shorten the time between user being interested and possibly going. Having to manually copy and paste the address could sway the user into not going, and that is something I wanted to minimize. The design also shows cases a join event and create event button that would allow users to manage what they are going to or possibly hosting through the app, which would attract more users as a result. By getting users more active the chance of user retention goes up.
                
                </p>
        <div class="container">
        <img src="networking sketch 3.jpg">
    </div>
        <p>The tutorial page would have a video of either the first tutorial or load to the tutorial where they left off on.  These videos would help guide users and are pre-recorded for ease of distribution. They would be stored natively on the app for fast play and would range anywhere from beginning networking tips to advanced. Another aspect I wanted to focus on as a relative advantage over other applications for networking is an opportunity to connect career mentors to mentees. This would be a point that could function as monetization, taking a small margin over the employee cost to gain some revenue, and would also create a very personalized experience for the user.

               <br><br> The profile page serves as the “home base” for the user – here they can edit their information, input some new interests, or link their social media profiles. They can also alter their search settings and how they appear to others to tailor the app to their needs.
                </p>

        <h3>UX Design - Low Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
        <p>To better understand how the information would flow and be presented to the user, I decided to make some low fidelity prototypes, the reasoning behind this being that if misconceptions or features that are not feasible are spotted, it could be easily corrected without having to waste too much time or money.</p>

        <div class="container">
        <img src="Lowfidelity networking.png" >
        </div>
        <p>A frame that shows how the app could possibly be assorted and presented to the user is detailed above. Note the distinct pages that can be navigated to using a static nav bar on the bottom, likely with icons that would point to the function of the page without having to use text. The welcome page would also have options to sign in with other mediums such as google, LinkedIn, or even Apple.

               <br><br> This gives a general idea of how I would want the product to look like and function, which allows me to create some higher fidelity prototypes to test the interaction, and see how it moves in motion.
                </p>

        <h3>UX Design - High Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
        <p>The core functionality of the application must be represented in its aesthetics, and flow logically in a way that would attract a user but remain usable at the forefront. I used the low fidelity prototypes and sketches as a guide in creating the main screens, and then thought of logical spin-offs in what would be necessary in an application like this in terms of functionalities.

               <br><br> To begin, I needed to create a branding for this application. I am not much of a brand design guy, so I thought of creating something both slick and not too far off the main problem – networking. What I came up with was “Xwrkr.” The main brand color palette is represented below.
                </p>

            <div class="container">
            <img src="xwrkr brandcolorw.jpg">
        </div>

            <p>Now that that is established I can go and start creating the first screens of the application, and showcase how the information flows.</p>

            <h3>Login:</h3>
            <p>The first aspect I want to focus on is the log-in experience of the application. There are two actionable start-states: A new user, and a cached saved user. These differ in the messages that they display upon opening the application. With a cached saved user, the application will display the preferred name of the user, which creates a more welcoming starting experience. This can be seen in the animation below.


                </p>
                <video  class ="center" controls="controls" width="800" height="600" 
                name="Log In" src="Log In 1.mov"></video>

                <video class ="center" controls="controls" width="800" height="600" 
                name="Saved User Login" src="Welcome Back Log In.mov"></video>

        <p>These two clips show the respective intro screens, and how it flows into the main connect page. Both originate from the logo screen shown in clip 2 that is triggered by a delay of 1200 milliseconds.</p>
        
                <p>Next, I defined the alternative methods to log into the application that don’t use the traditional log-in password method, such as logging in with google or LinkedIn. Both would allow the application to parse the information and fill out the profile of the user automatically, which can save them some time in inputting information over and over again. I used the brand standards from both companies, and included links to their native websites in case the user wants to create an account through the app. This can be seen in the clips below.


        </p>

        <h3>Connect:</h3>

        <p>The first clip shows the google sign-in page, and how it would flow to the connect page that was shown in the previous clips. Note that upon signing in for the first time from this new account, which is denoted by the “someone new?” signifier on the log-in screen, the user is prompted with a consent message that asks if it is okay to use location services for the app. This is to fit under industry standards, and ethical limitations of data use.

                <p>The second clip shows the LinkedIn log in, with the signup for LinkedIn being a clickable element that directs the user to the LinkedIn Sign Up page.</p>

                name="LinkedIn Login" src="Linkedin Login.mov"></video>


                <p>Next, I wanted to define the new user sign up flow. It would need to originate from the log-in page, and then ask for their information and a basic set of questions that would help configure their settings to acclimatize them quicker and tailor their user experience to make it more personal. This is shown in the clip below.</p>

                <video  class ="center" controls="controls" width="400" height="600" 
                name="Newuser Login" src="new User login.mov"></video>

                <p>This is the first and primary functionality of the application, which is to connect the user with other professionals in their area. The application naturally flows to this without the need for user input after log-in, showing them that this is the most important aspect. It can be navigated to using the left most button on the navbar. The cards are divided by 3 main subcategories: ranked by top match percentage (which is determined through a combination of shared interests, backgrounds, location and profession), a subcategory featuring people with solely the highest shared interest, and a category from those from the same school. This would facilitate conversation by giving the two people things in common for them to start conversations, and to ease the friction between new interactions. A clip of how the information would be presented in terms of a user card is shown below. Take note of the "favorite" control, and some conversation starters to make it easier to start conversations and create connections</p>

                name="connect" src="Connect User flow.mov"></video>

                <p>The main match list can also be expanded to show the top 10 matches by percentage, and the search criteria can be changed to the user’s wishes to customize how closely the match is. This is represented in the clip below.</p>

                name="connect" src="Expanded Connect.mov"></video>

            <h3>Events:</h3>
            <p>The second core functionality of the application as determined through user research is providing users with events in their areas that are dedicated to networking and help them to find these and also to create them. The events page shows them an expanded map of their areas, and shows events close by, which can serve as an easy way to find something to do, as well as a list of a couple of events that is highly matched to a user’s profile, and can help facilitate their networking possibilities. On the bottom there is also a create events function that would allow them to host events and invite people in their area. The two clips below showcase this.

                </p>

                <video class ="center" controls="controls" width="400" height="600" 
                name="Events" src="Events Page.mov"></video>

            <p>The user interviews stated that events dedicated to networking helped them lessen the anxiety of having to go up to random people because it was a situation where everyone was there for that sole reason. Setting up these events can be invaluable, especially because the user can set the level of formality, the dress code, and what kind of events they might want to go to. This could range from formal banquets to casual boba runs, as shown in the events page.</p>

            <h3>Learn:</h3>
                
            <p>The third and final core functionality that I wanted to focus on in this product was a section dedicated to learning about how to network. Given the target audience of the application is young professionals, likely just getting out of college or in college, the pull for a way to learn something like networking that is abstract becomes tangible. The solution to this problem would be to include videos that could help them learn, as well as in house mentors.</p>
            
            <video class ="center" controls="controls" width="400" height="600" 
            name="Learn Page 2" src="Learn Page 2.mov"></video>
       
            <p>In house mentors could be a point of monetization for the product, charging a premium over the wage of the mentor to collect revenue. This could be implemented in a premium subscription or on a by-order basis. Mentorship could be from step by step help with a career to a business relationship with someone senior in your field, according to what the user wants. This is a point of relative advantage over existing products, because it does not facilitate these mentorship relationships. 

                </p>


            <h3>Profile:</h3>

            <p>The final point of navigation on the nav bar is the profile section, this would display where the user could change their information and configure their settings. The Profile section is split up into 4 main subgroups, “Settings”, “Account”, “Phone”, and “Security.” Settings controls general settings such as how visible the user is to other people, search criteria, if they would like to appear offline or online, and other miscellaneous settings. Account is where they can manage their location, profile pic, display name, and email address. Phone is where they can manage their phone settings, such as setting custom chimes, and manage their notifications. Security would allow users to change their password and manage the security of their interactions. The clip below showcases the profile page.


                </p>

                <video class ="center" controls="controls" width="400" height="600" 
                name="Profile Page" src="Profile Page.mov"></video>

                <p>One aspect to be aware of when creating an application that allows people to meet who would otherwise be the strangers is the social responsibility of the creators of the product to do all they can to make sure their users are safe in their interactions. The security subsection would come with a guide on how to stay safe in these interactions, and also with places to report users who are displaying aggressive or unsafe behavior.

                    </p>

         
               <h3>Next Steps:</h3>

                <p>This application is largely a passion project targeting a problem that I see in my everyday life. To become better as an all-around developer I would like to try to develop it, but given that I am an amateur in backend development, it would likely take a lot of time to actually create. This project taught me a lot about how sprawling design projects can get when considering all the aspects of improving or creating something. I included a picture below of all the prototyping connections to give you an idea. In put into perspective the need to always create multiple iterations, and it makes me want to go back to the drawing board and revisit this application after learning more. I am passionate about this idea, and this type of product, and think it could make a real difference for some people to ease that friction between creating meaningful connections.</p>
