    <h3 class="portfolio">Background</h3>

    <p>
      This project was part of my year-long internship that eventually converted into a fulltime design contractor role for Demandbase. All rights for designs belong to Demandbase.

<br><br>A lot of B2B design is predicated around datatables - presenting information within these tables in a clear, concise and contextual manner is an art of its own. This project was an ongoing undertaking to refresh and rebrand the platform datatables. While a big portion of this project was focused on the visual design of the tables and ensuring that we deliver a slick, elegant solution, an ongoing study was done on improving the usability of the tables, and ensuring the data is clean and human readable. We completed this through user testing and rounds of iteration to deliver an updated and powerful new component that went live in 2022.

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
   

    <p>The project came about in the form of user feedback: 


       <br><br> “The tables in this product are often too cluttered and hard to read, there are confusing click throughs that make it hard to understand where I am in the product, and makes the entire product feel unfinished”
        
       <br><br>There are quite a few good tidbits to work on here, but I tried to refine it into a central problem statement I could work with.
        
       <br><br><b>How might we create powerful, human readable and contextual data tables in our core products?</b>
        

       <img class = "portimage" src="./example table.png">

         <br><br> The hard part of this problem statement was managing the specific needs of the different products of Demandbase. Each product segment had different needs in terms of the type of data being shown, so the tables started to look drastically different in terms of the aesthetic.
        
        </p>
    
      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>The first part of the problem was understanding just exactly which target areas needed the most help, heuristic wise. This would narrow our scope to a problem space that we could actually attend to. To do this, I went through the core data tables in the product one by one, and categorized them by type, pointing out the common feedback we have received through the perspective of the problem statement.
      </p>

      <img class = "portimage" src="./contextual needs.png">

      <img class = "portimage" src="./readable problems.png">

      <p>One constant point of feedback was surrounding the analytics tables in particular as they cram a lot of information into one data table. One table in particular was a prime example of the problems at hand: the engagement table.
      </p>

      <img class = "portimage" src="./eng before.png">


      <p>The engagement table was a microcosm of all the problems faced due its data dense format, the presence of multiple links, and the sheer volume of data present. As shown in the picture above, there are 7,146 Pages in the activity tab, and 176 thousand rows to look at. This type of data is impossible to monitor proactively, so we need a way to condense this contextually, and provide new ways to monitor this information.

      <br><br>  The first thing I considered in making data more contextual was to provide a story. Why do I want to use this table? What metrics am I looking at? How often do I check? 
        
      <br><br>  These questions inform information architecture, prominence and default states, so they were important questions to answer. Unfortunately, these answers weren’t ready available so we needed to speak to some people who knew the situation better. They were able to yield the following key points:
        </p>


        <img class = "portimage" src="./Usecases.png">

        <h3>Solution</h3>

        <p>Taking into account the use cases detailed above, I started to brainstorm a solution, and came up with a component that addressed both the context and usability issues: <b>An expand and collapse component.</b>
        </p>

        <img class = "portimage" src="./expandcollapsepros.png">
        <p>There are two parts to figure out - what are we showing/hiding, and the aesthetic of it. To start with what we are showing and what to hide, I considered just exactly what we are showing, and tried to create a story out of it:
        </p>



        <img class = "portimage" src="./hierarchy.png">

        <p>This would allow us to hide some of the information that is associated. For the aesthetic to represent this, I initially kept the same visual cue with a blank first column to indicate branching, as seen below. After reviewing it with internal employees, this mental model was not tracking, so I instead turned to a master detail view which would allow a unique inner header. This was supported by our table framework, AG Grid, which made it a logical option, as shown in the screenshot below.
        </p>

        <img class = "portimage" src="./expandcollapsefirstpass.png">
        <img class = "portimage" src="./ag grid example.png">

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>Our testing was conducted with a mix of external and internal users who were asked to complete basic tasks through a moderated session. Some of the key insights were packaged into cards:
        </p>

        <img class = "portimage" src="./testing tables.png">
        <p>The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, but there were a few areas of improvement:
          <br><br> - Searching through the tables
          We hadn’t thought through this fully, and we would need to engage with this again to see how users conceptualized searching the inner table and outer table.
          
          <br><br> - Icon sizing
          We used a small karat icon to indicate expansion, but this was often missed.
          
        <br><br> - We need this in other tables!
          Site analytics was another table that really needed this treatment.
          </p>

          <h3>Final Result</h3>
          <p>The first major change was changing the hierarchy of the tabs by shifting them around to fit the mental model of how a user goes through the table. They first engage with an account, see the associated score, and then move over to individuals in that account and the activities associated with that person. To reflect this, I changed the hierarchy as such: 
          </p>

          <img class = "portimage" src="./hierarchychange.png">

          <p id ="solution">The final result after making the changes suggested in the testing session resulted in the following comprehensive flow:
          </p>

          <div class = "image-container">
            <img class = "portimage" src="./Accounts closed.png">
            <img class = "portimage" src="./Accounts open.png">
        </div>


          <p>This flow show cases the interaction between the accounts tab, which is the main paradigm in Account Based Marketing. Seeing which accounts have engagement shows you directly who to target in campaigns, or to move along in your sales and marketing funnels. Expansion could be triggered by clicking the entire row, which changes on hover to show an affordance of expansion.
          </p>

          <div class = "image-container">
            <img class = "portimage" src="./People closed.png">
            <img class = "portimage" src="./People Open.png">
        </div>


          <p>The next is digging into the activities for a specific person, this allows you to find out who to target in campaigns, or to reach out to directly for sales opportunities.
          </p>

          <div class = "image-container">
            <img class = "portimage" src="./Activities closed.png">
            <img class = "portimage" src="./Activities Open.png">
        </div>


          <p>Seeing which type of activity is most successful allows you to tailor your marketing attempts to invest in successful activities, as well as see exactly who is engaging with critical types. For example, with this design you could take all the people are attending a specific webinar, and add them to an account list to sell to. This gives the activities tab, which was a conventional data dump, a true purpose.
          </p>

          <div class = "image-container">
            <img class = "portimage" src="./search exploration other opp.png">
            <img class = "portimage" src="./search exploration.png">
        </div>

          <p>The last piece was thinking through the search pattern for this type of table. Searching the outer layer would only search through the top table which doesn’t match user expectation. To get around this, I proposed a search that went through the entire table, and highlighted areas that match in both the top, and the bottom layer.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning + applying the component towards other tables
          </h3>


          <p>This was a really interesting project that really forced me to scope down general feedback into clean, concise improvements. In the end I was able to deliver a component that was playfully named “iTables” to showcase my effort on them. They went into production GA in June 2022, but a proof of concept was implemented in the end of 2021 with the ad plans table, which I will include below.
          </p>
