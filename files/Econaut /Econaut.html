    <p style="font-weight: bold;">The Scope of the project</p>
    <p>Team: Sharad Bhagwat, Joey Hoang<br>
        Tools: Figma, Google Docs, Google Forms<br>
        Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, NodeJS, AJAX <br>
        Role: UX Designer, Front End Developer<br>
        Timeline: 6 weeks</p>
    


    <h3>Project Summary:</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This project was a quarter-long effort undertaken in Winter of 2020-21 at UC San Diego, as part of an upper division Design Course. The class gave 5 different core problem domains to choose from that were quite high level, which allowed us flexibility to define the problems as we want. Our domains intersected between “Mindfulness” and the “Quantified Self” which we took to be understanding your own impact onto the world. This project had multiple stages that went through various levels of implementation, which was a general constraint for the project. While we all had cursory knowledge of implementation frameworks, such as HTML, CSS, Java and JS, we did not have a technical lead per se, and relied on a lot of coding by committee. This constraint did hinder us in parts of our design, which we note when it occurs. 
    </p>


    <!---
    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Creativity in the Constraint of Coding</p>
    <p>The core theme of this studio was finding ways to quantify and understand one's self. While the prompt is vague, it allows you to be creative and define that in any way that you want.</p>

    <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">How our problem statement changed over time</p>

    <p>Our first problem statement was: <br>It can be easy to disregard one’s impact on the world around them. Tracking user’s daily habits can provide an opportunity for users to contextualize how their everyday lives impact the world and how they can create a more efficient and sustainable lifestyle.</p>

    <p>This evolved into:</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8987F9;">Riddled by expanding choices, and a lack of guidance, ethical consumers find it hard to compile and understand the ocean of potential choices on the market. They need a way to synthesize, conceptualize and identify their choices effectively.
    </h4>

    </div> 
    <p>To better understand this problem statement we took a significant amount of time in understanding what the competition was, and what were the high water marks in each product area. At this point we wanted to remain as vague as possible, but taking the time to find areas that we could potentially explore after.
    </p>


    <h3>Ideation and Wireframing:</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>After marking the high water marks for the area, we brainstormed what kind of novel interactions that each one had, and what made them novel. This helped us to shape how we would create something that defines its own niche.
        From here, we had to hone in on a specific space to think about. Keeping in mind our studio, which was the quantified self, we had to find ways to quantify and conceptualize ones impact on the world, and we came to a consensus that one very important way to do that is through environmental impact, also known as Ecological footprint.
   <br><br> To guide this thinking we made small storyboards to help us empathize withour user, and understand why they were using a digital solution to a physical problem. </p>
        <img src="storyboard econaut.png" alt="Networking" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; max-width: 35%;">

    
    <p>To do this, we are ideated, and thought of an environmental database for foods, in which a user could search up potential foods that they might have or are shopping for, see recipes, and then see what their environmental impact is on the world.
    We proceeded to make paper prototypes to test this idea, and found it was a success!

      <br><br>
      <p>Ecological footprint can be captured on a high level, but often does not take into account the small actions that someone does on a daily basis, and thus cannot be as accurate. An interesting way that we looked at it was through a significant  contributor to the world’s pollution, food.
        Food, and especially red meats, contribute greatly to the world’s pollution through the creation of methane or the factory farming methods. We wanted to help inform an average person, and help equip them with the tools they need to make an ethical decision.
        </p>


    <h3>Pivot Moment:</h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Finding a new Niche</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the high water mark for this idea was hard to top (such as the EWG healthy living app, pictured below), so we went back to the drawing board and decided to pivot to a field that was less well defined, but apply the same core principles, which were detailed below:</p>
    <img src="existing apps econaut.jpeg" alt="Networking" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; max-width: 20%;">

    <h4>"While there are many different ways to stay sustainable, we often rely on other individuals to inform us about best practices in meeting these sustainability goals.
      
        By placing the information at the fingertips of someone who cares, you are able to empower them." </h4>
    <img src="greenercars.png" alt="Networking" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; max-width: 50%;">
    <p>The field of buying cars has a plethora of resources, yet we found it hard to find a centralized source of information for sustainability. Competitors such as GreenerCars, pictured above, did not make it easy for the user to compare, but was more of a data dumpk</p>


    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Brainstorming Ideas</p>

    <img src="key interactions.png" alt="Networking" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; max-width: 80%;">
    



    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Outlining Implementation Plan</p>
    <p>Our final idea was to create a sustainable database - but for cars. 
        Cars are an interesting field because there are tons of options out on the market, and it can be overwhelming and often downright confusing at times to do research in the right direction. What we decided to do was create a way to quickly find and compare car options so that user’s could remain informed about what a certain car's impact was, and how they could change that score.
        </p>
    



    <h3>Testing:</h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Planned Testing on NNG Heuristics</p>
    
    <img src="Econaut evaluation.png" alt="Networking" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; max-width: 50%;">
    <p>We used the Nielsen Norman Heuristics as a guiding factor, having other designers and ourselves validate our design.</p>

    <img src="failed iterations.png" alt="Networking" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; max-width: 75%;">
    <p>Some of the key feedback helped us to make decisions on what was necessary in the app and what wasn't, with one key aspect being the checkmark and X that was quite prominent on the quick cards.
        
    <br><br>
    Our users that we interviewed stated that they felt that these indications were a sign of leading information, where we as the curators of this data are passing our own judgement, and potential bias. So instead we decided to present the numbers, and how that stacks up relatively to let the users make their own decisions.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Final Reflection</p>
    <p>This project was quite difficult, as it involved a lot of painstaken development as we learned the technologies as we were designing. This lead to a lot of hard decisions on what is absolutely necessary, and what is not. In the end we were able to overcome a lot of our technological issues, and release something that is still live.

        <br><br> Past learning a lot of new languages and frameworks, I was able to understand and empathize with the Devs that I work with, it led me to want to understand the constraints that come with design more, and something I plan to do in the future.
