            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Terraform Cloud has the concept of “Tags” within the product, and also as an object type within  the cloud block in a terraform configuration file. Tags were introduced to allow users to quickly organize, correlate and filter the core resource of Terraform Cloud, Workspaces.
            </p>

            <h3 id="research" >So what's wrong?            </h3 >
            <p>The issue is that tags in their current inception were useful, but limited in how customers think about and use tags. A single value string when applied to an object is useful for filtering usecases, but doesn’t necessarily map to the entire spectrum of user types in Terraform Cloud. To illustrate this, lets consider two personas: 
            </p>


            <div class="blockcard">
              <h3>Core personas</h3>

                <div>
                  <h4>Appo the app developer</h4>
                  <p>This individual finds value in the current state of tags, using it mainly to filter</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div class="row">

                  <h4>Plata the app Platform Engineer</h4>
                  <p>The platform engineer, or the Terraform expert of their organization, <b>likely won’t find value in the current implementation of tags</p></b>
              </div>

            <p>To understand why, lets map outs the platform engineer journeys to illustrate where the current implementation of tags is lacking
            </p>

            <P><br>So what we can tell is that key value tags are a major type of tag that our customers want to use, but can't currently. Which makes sense since the other platforms that our core users are mainly in, Cloud Service Providers, also have this concept.
            </P>

          <h3>Key Learning
          </h3>
          <p>Customers desire the ability to tag their cloud resource with key value pairs.</p>

        <div class="block">
          <h3>So how are they currently used?          </h3>
          <p>When you look at tags, you can start to categorize them into 2 types.

<br><br>            One type of tag is largely arbitrary and is added by the end user (the app developer that I just mentioned), while the other type of tag is more administrative, likely by the second persona mentioned, the platform engineer!
           </p>

           <img src="./commonlyused.png" class="img-wrap-2" style="max-width: 75%;">

           <p>The more administrative type of tags also come with a key characteristic, they likely feature a key and a value, which allows you to organize resources by value based indicators. There was only one problem… Terraform Cloud didn’t support this natively.

           <br><br> Users started to hack their way around it, and add delimiters like “:” and “=” within a single value tag to try to do this, and the data showed that 36% of all tags had some kind of janky delimiter in there, proving need for this in the application.
            </p>

        <div class="block" id="ideation">
          <h3>Designing a better tags</h3>
          <p>To begin we had to ascertain exactly what the user need is here. We knew that generally there was demand for this type of tag, and that users were hacking their way around the current implementation, but we didn’t know exactly how users were setting up tags in their organization.
 
            <br><br>To approach this, my PM and I engaged with 4 different customers who expressed interest in this sort of thing. We focused on specifically the platform engineer persona that I mentioned before, as they were the persona type that was the least served by the current model.

            <h3>Problem statement</h3>
            <p>Tags as a concept is ineffective in allowing customers to perform more administrative tasks, such as managing billing, audit, and RBAC. The current implementation is too permissive, meaning anyone can add or remove tags, and a tag itself cannot be added at a project level. This causes the customer to have to more manual busy work on their end to maintain a system of record of internal metadata to keep up.</p>

        <h4>Inheritence with edge cases        </h4>
        <p>One of the key issues to solve was how to convey inheritence, which is the concept that lower level resources are able to inherit higher level metadata through tags. This concept was already easily understood in the cloud infrastructure world, but birthed a lot of complexity with understanding all the possible edge cases, and where there might need to be design work to understand it.

        <h4>Filtering by tags
        </h4>
        <p> When a tag is created and applied to a resource, one of the core user journeys that a user will accomplish is filtering. A key example is taking a large list of resources like all the workspaces in an organization, and filtering it down to the subset that includes the "env:prod" tag. When considering the technical implementation, the metaphor that matched the most was akin to a query, so the design reflected that. A user would search for a tag and then a list of resources that match that tag would return.

        <h3 id=#conclusion>Customer reactions</h3>

        <p>Customer sentiment was overwhelmingly positive for this feature. Many customers had been asking for this for a long time, and could finally stop having to create bespoke solutions or hack their way around managing cloud resources. Cost attribution is one of those things that can actually negatively influence engagement from a contract perspective because customers are fearful about going over their contracted entitlement quota. As a result of enabling more accurate cost attribution with key value tags, customers felt more confident about using the amount that they bought.

        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

       <p> While adding something like tags might seem trivial or tablestakes, it was actually quite a large effort that took many months. A large part of this was implementation discussions at a larger platform level, in which many teams engaged on discussions for how tags should work not only for Terraform, but also for other HashiCorp Cloud products. That delayed our timelines and restricted our scope, but gave us a solution that was stronger.

        <br<br>I feel that the main skill I developed was learning how to navigate the latent tensions of an EPD structure during the implementation phase. Our project was at risk, and it felt like cutting corners on the proposed design was the easiest way to meet our deadlines. At the base level, I understood, but I also learned how to pick my battles in advocating for a better experience while also staying pragmatic in how we bring value to our customers. This isn’t really something taught in school, so it was nice to get some reps in to further build that skill.
