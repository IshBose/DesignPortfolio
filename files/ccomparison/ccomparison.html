                <br><br>Humans are constantly comparing new sensory information to a point of reference that we already understand. We can adopt this mental model into the products that we create to take an advantage of this.
                
                <br><br> Now we have to figure out what to compare, with the core metrics being listed in advertising below:
                </p>

                <img class ="portimage" src="./slides/Viz options.png">

                <br><br>


                <P>From these, we can narrow down the type of comparisons possible to one core type, Targeting. The main campaigns summary card delivers cumulative information for bulk selected campaigns, and we could use these metrics to compare one campaign to another, using a benchmark.

                  <br><br> To determine a direction for visualizing this comparison, I needed to scan the advertising product to see which patterns were in use.

        <div class="subtitle">Key takeaways </div>
        <h4>I really loved getting to see this feature from ideation to concept validation, it showed the value of contextualizing information in B2B design.</h4>
        <p>This project was extremely fun throughout. I was able to lead a new feature release from the initial secondary research all the way up to development, and it was gratifying throughout the way. Hearing both negative and positive sentiments during user testing sessions helped me to improve in being able to rapidly act on feedback and address user needs. 

          <br><br>I gained experience working on a new feature from scratch, learning project sizing in order to avoid scope creep, and working closely with user researchers to improve designs through feedback and iterations. A lot of the theory that is packed in the classroom became apparent through this project, and I was able to apply a lot of the skills that I learned.<br><br> If I had more time to work on this, I would try to test with more users who aren’t as familiar with the product. Due to time constraints, we were only able to test with a small number of external users, and mostly internal users who are power users. This can skew the actual adoption of the feature, as these users tend to behave a little differently, and have ready access to more support internally.

      <div class="block">
        <div class="subtitle">Next steps</div>
        <h4>If I had more time...</h4>
        <p>A followup on this project that would be a v2 improvement would be to show campaign metrics in a small expandable table below the comparison. This was heavily asked for during our user testing sessions for ease of access. The information is actually baked into the tooltips in the chart, but would be easier to parse with a table.
